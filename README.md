## Features

### 1. **Mini-games**
   Plant-X includes educational mini-games to help users better understand and raise awareness about environmental hazards affecting farming. 

   - **Drought Print**: Match areas with the corresponding drought intensity color to reveal the distribution of data and map it. This game helps players learn about how droughts impact different regions.
   
   - **Harvest Hero**: In this time-bound game, choose the correct action according to the hazard that occurs, guiding the plant from seed to flower. This interactive experience helps players understand the necessary actions to protect crops from hazards.

### 2. **Scan Crops**
   Using AI-powered technology, users can scan a crop leaf and get an instant diagnosis of its health. The app predicts whether the leaf is healthy, infected with rust, or affected by powdery mildew, along with the percentage of severity. This feature provides quick insights for farmers and researchers working with crops.

### 3. **AR Simulation**
   This feature allows users to simulate a farm field using augmented reality. You can visualize the shape and structure of a field under different hazard conditions (e.g., drought, flood). The AR simulation helps farmers and students see how specific hazards affect farm layouts and plant growth.
